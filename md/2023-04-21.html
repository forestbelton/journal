<p>I find myself on the Steam Store a lot. It’s fun to click around and look at games, but I rarely make a purchase. Recently, a game in the “popular upcoming” section called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2280000/SQUARE_ENIX_AI_Tech_Preview_THE_PORTOPIA_SERIAL_MURDER_CASE/">SQUARE ENIX AI Tech Preview: THE PORTOPIA SERIAL MURDER CASE</a> caught my attention. The Steam page has this to say about the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This software is an educational demonstration of Natural Language Processing (NLP), an AI technology, as applied to the adventure game “The Portopia Serial Murder Case” (created by Yuji Horii and first published in Japan in 1983). At the time of the game’s original release, most adventure games were played using a “command input” system, where the player was asked to type in text to decide the actions of their character. Free text input systems like these allowed players to feel a great deal of freedom. However, they did come with one common source of frustration: players knowing what action they wanted to perform but being unable to do so because they could not find the right wording. This problem was caused by the limitations of PC performance and NLP technology of the time. 40 years have passed since then, and PC performance has drastically improved, as have the capabilities of NLP technology. Using “The Portopia Serial Murder Case” as a test case, we’d like to show you the capabilities of modern NLP and the impact it can have on adventure games, as well as deepen your understanding of NLP technologies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s exciting to see a company like Square Enix experimenting with NLP technology. I wonder what techniques they are using to accomplish this. Unfortunately, it seems like they haven’t shared any details about it yet. The blog for SQUARE ENIX AI Division] has this to say on its <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/ai-division/en/2023/04/square-enix-ai-tech-preview-the-portopia-serial-murder-case-will-be-available.html">latest post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So what is NLP? Don’t worry, our experts will explain it soon on this AI technology blog. In the meantime, please wait a while and try the trending technology called NLP for yourself!</p>

<h2 id="colossal-cave-adventure">Colossal Cave Adventure</h2>
<p>I got inspired to try my hand at enhancing a text adventure game myself. What better place to start than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure">Colossal Cave Adventure</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Crowther_(programmer)">Will Crowther</a>? Widely considered the first text adventure game in the “interactive fiction” genre, Colossal Cave Adventure (or “Adventure”) centers around entering a cave system with unknown treasures inside. For a wealth of information about the game and its creation, check out the lovely site by <a href="https://rickadams.org/adventure/">Rick Adams</a>.</p>
<h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>
<p>The two goals for this project were:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Have fun</li>
<li>Improve understanding of software (PyTorch, RWKV-LM, OpenAI API, et al.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, the approach I took probably wasn’t the most effective or canonical method. However, it gave me an excuse to play with a few new technologies, and I learned a lot.</p>
<h3 id="game-command-execution">Game command execution</h3>
<p>I chose <a href="https://gitlab.com/esr/open-adventure">open-adventure</a> for an implementation of Colossal Cave Adventure. I really enjoyed seeing that ESR was actively developing it. The game instructions include the following message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will be your eyes and hands. Direct me with commands of 1 or 2 words. I should warn you that I look at only the first five letters of each word, so you’ll have to enter “Northeast” as “ne” to distinguish it from “North.” (Should you get stuck, type “help” or “info” for some general hints).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what the <a href="https://gitlab.com/esr/open-adventure/-/blob/f0119f8431be30713e29ef89a63a45d0fa28111c/advent.h#L282">game’s command type</a> looks like (comments my own):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="kw">typedef</span> <span class="kw">struct</span> {</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>    <span class="kw">enum</span> speechpart part; <span class="co">// unknown, intransitive, transitive</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true"></a>    command_word_t word[<span class="dv">2</span>]; <span class="co">// NO_WORD_TYPE, MOTION, OBJECT, ACTION, NUMERIC</span></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true"></a>    verb_t verb; <span class="co">// Command verb parsed from word array</span></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5" aria-hidden="true"></a>    obj_t obj; <span class="co">// Command object parsed from word array (transitive only)</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6"><a href="#cb1-6" aria-hidden="true"></a>    command_state_t state;</span>
<span id="cb1-7"><a href="#cb1-7" aria-hidden="true"></a>} command_t;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are four types of words, sourced from a <a href="https://gitlab.com/esr/open-adventure/-/blob/f0119f8431be30713e29ef89a63a45d0fa28111c/adventure.yaml">YAML dictionary</a>: Locations the player can move to, specific in-game objects, player actions, and nonnegative integers. The user inputs 1-2 of these words for a command. If the game doesn’t have enough context to execute an action, it may ask the player followup questions. Once enough context is available, <a href="https://gitlab.com/esr/open-adventure/-/blob/f0119f8431be30713e29ef89a63a45d0fa28111c/main.c#L1165">the action is performed</a>.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
<p>After I learned about the available user commands, I came up with a strategy to augment Colossal Cave Adventures with English language support.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Perform chat completion with OpenAI to complete word fragments in the game dictionary, since all words greater than 5 characters have been truncated. This is completely overkill but very cool.</li>
<li>Generate a corpus of sentences that map plain English sentences into game commands using a command-to-word mapping.</li>
<li>Finetune an <a href="https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM">RWKV-LM</a> model on the example sentences. Ideally, this will use <a href="https://huggingface.co/BlinkDL/rwkv-4-pile-169m">RWKV-Pile-169M</a> since it has the lowest hardware requirements.</li>
<li>Write a program that reads user input in a loop, using the finetuned model to generate a game command which is sent to an open-adventure subprocess. The output of the game is piped back to the user’s console.</li>
</ol>
<p>Over the next couple of days, I will describe how each component was built. The last post will include a link to the repository where you can play the augmented game. Better brush up on those caving skills!</p>
